# Dependencies

No third party lib.

# Compile

Compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio code 2019 (version 16.2.5)

# Test mode

Test mode can be enabled in file main.c with the macro TEST set to 1.
In that case, the program will display the text "HELLO WORLD" from time 0 to time 220.

# Improvements

- Add unittest (using libcheck with visual code?)
- Pass pointer to matrix instead of all matrix (stack saving)
- Fonction to dynamically generate Ascii char instead of hardcoded ones.
